## ‚ú® How It Works: The Magic of MCP

Buyer Whisperer creates a secure, real-time connection between your Instagram account and your AI assistant (Claude) using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

1.  **Command:** You give a simple, natural language command to Claude (e.g., "Who are my hottest leads?").
2.  **Analysis:** The Buyer Whisperer server securely fetches your latest DM conversations. It creates a compact, text-only brief and asks your AI to analyze it for key sales metrics.
3.  **Insight:** The AI returns a structured analysis, which the server uses to identify top users or generate pitch prompts.
4.  **Action:** The server presents the insights back to you as a beautiful artifact or asks for confirmation to send AI-generated messages on your behalf.

This entire process happens on-demand, in seconds, without ever storing your conversations after the session ends.

## üß† The Intelligence: AI-Powered Marketing KPIs

Buyer Whisperer doesn't just read messages; it understands them. It scores every user on these critical sales KPIs:

| KPI | What It Tells You |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spending** | Flags hot leads already talking about buying. |
| **Price Focus** | Tells you if a discount hook will seal the deal. |
| **Trust** | No sale without belief in you, simple as that. |
| **Sentiment** | Mood check, lets you match tone before pitching. |
| **Curiosity** | High question count points to teach-then-sell copy. |
| **Language**| The user's primary language for multi-lingual pitching. |
| **Personality** | 5 adjectives to describe the user's vibe. |
| **Common Words** | The top 5 words the user repeats, great for mirroring. |
