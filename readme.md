## üí° The Problem: Your DMs are a Goldmine You Can't See

Your Instagram DMs are filled with critical sales signals. Customers asking about price, showing trust, hinting at a purchase... but it's all buried in thousands of lines of text. You can't scale your intuition, and valuable leads slip through the cracks every day.

## ‚ú® The Solution: AI-Powered Sales Intelligence

Buyer Whisperer acts as your personal AI analyst. It reads your latest conversations and instantly tells you:

*   **WHO is ready to buy?** (`spending` score)
*   **WHO trusts your brand?** (`trust` score)
*   **WHO is a price-sensitive bargain hunter?** (`price_focus` score)
*   **WHAT is the mood of the conversation?** (`sentiment` score)
*   **WHO is genuinely curious and needs information?** (`curiosity` score)

It doesn't just give you data; it gives you a ranked list of leads and helps you talk to them like a real person.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup Guide

Get up and running in under 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   **The Claude Desktop App** (This is essential for the interactive workflow)
*   An active Instagram account

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trypeggy/instagram_dm_mcp.git
cd instagram_dm_mcp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
This project uses standard Python packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Instagram Credentials
Create a `.env` file to securely store your credentials. The easiest way is to copy the example file:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and add your Instagram username and password.

### Step 4: Connect to the Claude Desktop App
This is the magic step that links Buyer Whisperer to your AI.

*   Find your Claude configuration file:
    *   **On Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **On Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
*   Open the file and add the following server configuration.

> **IMPORTANT:** You **must** replace `FULL/PATH/TO/instagram_dm_mcp` with the actual, absolute path to the project folder on your computer.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "insta_buyer": {
       "command": "python",
       "args": [
         "FULL/PATH/TO/instagram_dm_mcp/main.py"
       ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Restart Claude
Completely quit and restart the Claude Desktop app. If successful, **"Buyer Whisperer"** will now appear as an available tool in the tool-use panel.
